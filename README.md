# About This Project
This project is based on the master branch of [ChampSim](https://github.com/yousei-github/ChampSim) and [Ramulator](https://github.com/yousei-github/ramulator), and it can be modified to simulate hybrid memory systems. You can modify the preprocessors in the `./inc/ProjectConfiguration.h` file and recompile this project to try different functionalities. For example,
- Set the preprocessor `RAMULATOR` to `ENABLE` for enabling Ramulator or to `DISABLE` for just using ChampSim.
- Set the preprocessor `MEMORY_USE_HYBRID` to `ENABLE` for enabling hybrid memory systems or to `DISABLE` for enabling single memory systems.
- Set the preprocessor `PRINT_STATISTICS_INTO_FILE` to `ENABLE` for printing statistics into `.statistics` file.
- Set the preprocessor `PRINT_MEMORY_TRACE` to `ENABLE` for printing memory trace into `.trace` file. Each line in the trace file represents a memory request, with the hexadecimal address followed by 'R' or 'W' for read or write.
- Set the preprocessor `MEMORY_USE_SWAPPING_UNIT` to `ENABLE` for enabling data swapping function in memory controller. (Currently only support hybrid memory systems).
- Set the preprocessor `MEMORY_USE_OS_TRANSPARENT_MANAGEMENT` to `ENABLE` for enabling os transparent data management of hybrid memory systems, (Currently part of paper [CAMEO](https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2014.63), [MemPod](https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2017.39), variable granularity, TROM (Tracking Read Only Method), and TLTOM (Tracking Load and Translation Only Method) are implemented).
- Set the preprocessor `CPU_USE_MULTIPLE_CORES` to `ENABLE` for enabling multiple cores to run simulation. Note you also need to add multiple trace paths to execute this simulator.
- Set the preprocessor `BRANCH_PREDICTOR` to `BRANCH_USE_BIMODAL` for using bimodal branch predictor. Similarly, there have gshare, hashed_perceptron, perceptron branch predictors. Following this logic, you can also modify other preprocessors, such as `INSTRUCTION_PREFETCHER`, `LLC_REPLACEMENT_POLICY`, `LLC_PREFETCHER`, and so on.

The CPU's parameters are defined in the `./inc/ChampSim/champsim_constants.h` file.

# Run simulation
According to the setting in the `ProjectConfiguration.h` file, the input parameters vary. There are three types of the input pattern.
## 1. ChampSim + Ramulator with hybrid memory systems
If the preprocessor `RAMULATOR` is `ENABLE` and `MEMORY_USE_HYBRID` is `ENABLE`, execute the binary as the following,
```
$ [EXECUTION] --warmup-instructions [N_WARM] --simulation-instructions [N_SIM] [CFG1] [CFG2] [TRACE]
$ [EXECUTION] --warmup-instructions [N_WARM] --simulation-instructions [N_SIM] --stats [FILENAME] [CFG1] [CFG2] [TRACE]
```
where [EXECUTION] is the executable file's name, such as ./bin/champsim_plus_ramulator, [N_WARM] is the number of instructions for warmup (1 million), [N_SIM] is the number of instructinos for detailed simulation (10 million),
[CFG1] and [CFG2] are the memory configuration files' name (configs/HBM-config.cfg), [TRACE] is the trace name (619.lbm_s-4268B.champsimtrace.xz), [FILENAME] is the statistics file name. For example,
```
$ ./bin/champsim_plus_ramulator --warmup-instructions 1000000 --simulation-instructions 2000000 path_to_configs/HBM-config.cfg path_to_configs/DDR4-config.cfg path_to_traces/619.lbm_s-4268B.champsimtrace.xz
Simulation done. Statistics written to HBM_DDR4.stats
$ ./bin/champsim_plus_ramulator --warmup-instructions 1000000 --simulation-instructions 2000000 --stats my_output.txt path_to_configs/HBM-config.cfg path_to_configs/DDR4-config.cfg path_to_traces/619.lbm_s-4268B.champsimtrace.xz
Simulation done. Statistics written to my_output.txt
# NOTE: optional --stats flag changes the statistics output filename
```

## 2. ChampSim + Ramulator with single memory systems
If the preprocessor `RAMULATOR` is `ENABLE` and `MEMORY_USE_HYBRID` is `DISABLE`, execute the binary as the following,
```
$ [EXECUTION] --warmup-instructions [N_WARM] --simulation-instructions [N_SIM] [CFG1] [TRACE]
$ [EXECUTION] --warmup-instructions [N_WARM] --simulation-instructions [N_SIM] --stats [FILENAME] [CFG1] [TRACE]
```
where [EXECUTION] is the executable file's name, such as ./bin/champsim_plus_ramulator, [N_WARM] is the number of instructions for warmup (1 million), [N_SIM] is the number of instructinos for detailed simulation (10 million),
[CFG1] is the memory configuration file's name (configs/HBM-config.cfg), [TRACE] is the trace name (619.lbm_s-4268B.champsimtrace.xz), [FILENAME] is the statistics file name. For example,
```
$ ./bin/champsim_plus_ramulator --warmup-instructions 1000000 --simulation-instructions 2000000 path_to_configs/HBM-config.cfg path_to_traces/619.lbm_s-4268B.champsimtrace.xz
Simulation done. Statistics written to HBM.stats
$ ./bin/champsim_plus_ramulator --warmup-instructions 1000000 --simulation-instructions 2000000 --stats my_output.txt path_to_configs/HBM-config.cfg path_to_traces/619.lbm_s-4268B.champsimtrace.xz
Simulation done. Statistics written to my_output.txt
# NOTE: optional --stats flag changes the statistics output filename
```

## 3. ChampSim with single memory systems
If the preprocessor `RAMULATOR` is `DISABLE` and `MEMORY_USE_HYBRID` is `DISABLE`, execute the binary as the following,
```
$ [EXECUTION] --warmup-instructions [N_WARM] --simulation-instructions [N_SIM] [TRACE]
```
where [EXECUTION] is the executable file's name, such as ./bin/champsim_plus_ramulator, [N_WARM] is the number of instructions for warmup (1 million), [N_SIM] is the number of instructinos for detailed simulation (10 million), [TRACE] is the trace name (619.lbm_s-4268B.champsimtrace.xz). For example,
```
$ ./bin/champsim_plus_ramulator --warmup-instructions 1000000 --simulation-instructions 2000000 path_to_traces/619.lbm_s-4268B.champsimtrace.xz
Simulation done.
```

The number of warmup and simulation instructions given will be the number of instructions retired. Note that the statistics printed at the end of the simulation include only the simulation phase.

# How to create traces

Program traces are available in a variety of locations, however, many ChampSim users wish to trace their own programs for research purposes.
Example tracing utilities are provided in the `tracer/` directory.

# Evaluate Simulation

ChampSim measures the IPC (Instruction Per Cycle) value as a performance metric. <br>
There are some other useful metrics printed out at the end of simulation. <br>

# Miscellaneous

If IntelliSense still doesn't work properly, it might be because of the version of the C++ language standard used. To solve this problem, you need to open Visual Studio Code, click `View` -> `Command Palette`, and in the center where a terminal is popped out, input or select `C/C++: Edit Configurations (UI)`. A new file called `c_cpp_properties.json` should be created, and its UI is opened. After you modify `C++ standard` to `gnu++17` (or higher) in that file. IntelliSense should work properly now.

We use the [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) for code formatting of this project. To configure the path of the clang-format executable, please refer to the [settings.json](.vscode/settings.json). A simple tutorial for using clang-format is at [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/cpp-ide#_code-formatting).
